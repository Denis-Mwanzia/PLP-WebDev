# HTML Tags
 - HTML tags are building blocks of a webpage. They are used to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and much more.
 - Each HTML tag is wrapped in angle brackets, e.g., ```<tagname>```. Most tags have an opening and a closing version:
 - **SYNTAX**
   ```<tagname>Content</tagname>```

 - Some are self-closing (void tags), e.g., ```<img />```.
